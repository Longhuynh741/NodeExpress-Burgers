# Node-Express-Burgers

This project was created for the intents and purposes of combining MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and ORM skills in order to make a burger app. The objective of the project was for the user to be able to generate a burger app with GET,POST,and DELETE functions using express and have it render on the page using handlebar functions. Execution of this requires that we: <ul>
<li> Utilize npm packages to utilize express and handlebar functions
<li> Making use of the GET, POST, and DELETE methods to generate our own API calls.
<li> Troubleshooting errors along the way

</ul>

The project is done through the use of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and aide from [NPM documentations](https://www.npmjs.com/).

# Usage

The start of the Burger app happens all on the main a page. You will see two lists where your created burgers will go. In order to create a burger you will input the name inside the input area. Created burgers will appear under the "Dead Burger Walking" list. Users can "devour" the burgers and have it moved to the "Burgers We Ate" list.
